# ML.ai-Hackathon

1. The first step is EDA --> 1.1 Load the dataset --> 1.2 Explore the data using describe --> 1.3 Treating Missing Values--> 1.4 Outlier Analysis
2. The second step is Model --> 2.1 Use supervised algorithm for labeled_df --> 2.2 Use unsupervised algorithm for unlabeled_df --> 2.3 Use Ensemble learning method to find the classes for testing samples. Ensemble learning method includes two models(supervise for labeled_df and unsupervise for unlabeled_df).
3. See if to use PCA before using any classification model for supervised learning model. Also, if overfitting/underfitting occurs then try regularization method for supervised learning model.






* In outlier analysis, I replace the outliers by the class wise mean. Still there exist some outliers. For them I replace them by the upper bound. I don't knwo how which of both is better and when


Checkpoint 1--> before day 4 end do EDA of unsupervised and complete supervise model
