# ML.ai-Hackathon

1. The first step is EDA --> 1.1 Treating Missing Values-->1.2 Outlier Analysis
2. The second step is Model --> 2.1 Use supervised algorithm for labeled_df --> 2.2 Use unsupervised algorithm for unlabeled_df --> 2.3 Use Ensemble learning method to find the classes for testing samples. Ensemble learning method includes two models(supervise for labeled_df and unsupervise for unlabeled_df).
